# SeggySave (Abiotic Factor)
Tiny Windows utility to manage Abiotic Factor saves.
Aspirations for adding other games exist though, I guess.

## Features
- Open save folder shortcut
- Backup / restore the entire save directory (.zip)
- Export / import individual Worlds (Worlds/<world-name> folders)
- Auto-detects Steam profile folder (e.g. SaveGames\<steamID>\Worlds)
- Remembers a custom save path; one-click reset to default
- Dark mode! (ttkbootstrap “darkly”)
- Safe unzip (Prompts for overwrite)
- Auto-refreshes when Worlds change
- No external deps

## False Positive Warning
In case you receive this error running the .exe and get spooked easily, feel free to download and run `python SeggySave.py`.   
If you already have Python 3.x installed it should run no prollem.  
I just lazily packed it up with pyinstaller with the hopes of making things more streamlined.
